# AI-ML_Projects
A repository for keeping track of all my AI/ML projects that I have committed here and will commit in the future.

## Project 0: Aircraft Route Optimization System
This will be uploaded in a few days as it is the first AI project I worked on and its been a few years. I can't seem to find it... so a few days...
